# Avoid var Keyword: A Relic of the Past
Before ES6, the var keyword was the primary way to declare variables. However, it had some quirks and limitations that often led to unexpected results and made debugging more challenging.

In modern JavaScript, we generally avoid using var and instead opt for let and const, which offer more predictable and block-scoped behavior, making your code easier to understand and maintain.

# let: Variables that can change
Use the `let` keyword to declare variables whose values you might need to change later in your code.
